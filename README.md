sunfollower
===========

A simple arduino/attiny85 sun follower

This sun following project is a general purpose project to use 3 light dependent resistors (ldrs) and (currently) 2 hobby servos to build a platform that always points to the sun. This is useful when developing a solar concentrating distilling setup.

Future:
------

* Drive the dish with h-bridge motor controller

* Fit it into the attiny85 pin count
